# Entropy is NOT Disorder

I made a video using manim and the olive video editor, and it was a little
difficult and daunting to get started, so I decided to upload the code I used
for the video to help people who want to do things that are a little off the
beaten path, such as flipping coins or animating a bunch of particles moving
around randomly.

Anyway, you can find *[Entropy is NOT Disorder](https://youtu.be/sbDcsNTFKLI)*
at the link.
